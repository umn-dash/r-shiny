This is a new lesson built with [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench]. 

[workbench]: https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs

This workshop will be a foundational introduction to building websites and apps using the R Shiny framework. While knowing multiple languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, etc.) might otherwise be necessary to build a website, R Shiny allows R users to use just R code plus "R-like" code to assemble every part of a website. As such, R users can unlock the immense power of the world wide web by adding just another "half a language" to their toolbox! Topics include a brief introduction to HTML and CSS (as a frame of reference), project organization and conventions, input widgets, events and event handling, directive programming, building interactive tables, graphs, and maps, and updating complex graphics on the fly using proxies.
